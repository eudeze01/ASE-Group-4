Introduction
The purpose of this document is to provide clear guidance and documentation for the development team to effectively build the Dealride software solution. Additionally, it serves as a communication tool to align the project team, stakeholders, and developers on the objectives and scope of the software development project.

Overview of the Dealride Software
